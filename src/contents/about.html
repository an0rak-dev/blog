    <span>üëã</span>I'm Sylvain, a French Software engineer.

        By day, I'm a CI/CD Engineer at <a href="https://shadow.tech">Shadow</a>. I'm
        detached to the Platform squad, which develops and maintains all our servers and
        their software. My role is to automate all the part between the development of
        software, and the deployment of it in our datacenters all around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been working for more than a decade now (as you can see
        <a href="{{ base }}/resume.html">here</a>), and I've worked in a lot of domains :
        Web Front end applications, Backend applications (Java, JS, Go...), Cloud architecture,
        Bare-metal servers, quality assurance, testing and low-level system software.

        By night, I'm a father of two, loving Science-fiction, everything space related, and 
        virtual reality. For me, VR is a mean to an end, which is achieving what can't be achieved
        in real life. In this website, you can find the <a href="{{ base }}/projects.html">
        projects</a> I've been working on, when I'm not spending time with my family.

        I'm doing this website because, I'm kind of missing the old web. Where 
        everyone is owning a website or a blog, iirc chat rooms, mailing lists...
        That's why I'm doing this website, only to share my projects, my passions, and my thoughts.
        No politics, no religion, I don't care about those subjects. Only pure creation and technical
        stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you may have understand, this website is <i>very</i> personal. So I might express myself 
        in a more familiar way that what you can expect from someone you're working with. I might 
        even swear (and be imaginative in that). But don't be afraid, I'll always be respectful of 
        people anyway.
