    👋I'm Sylvain, a Software engineer, living in France.
</p>

<p>
    ☀️By day, I'm a CI/CD Engineer at <a href="https://shadow.tech">Shadow</a>. I'm
    detached to the Platform squad, which develops and maintains all our servers and
    their software. My role is to automate all the part between the development of
    software, and the deployment of it in our datacenters all around the world.
</p>
<p>
    I've been working for more than a decade now (as you can see
    <a href="{{ base }}/resume.html">here</a>), and I've work in a lot of domains :
    Web Front end applications, Backend applications (Java, JS, Go...), Cloud architecture,
    Bare-metal servers, quality assurance, testing and low-level system software.
